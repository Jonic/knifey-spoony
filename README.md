## What is PICO-8?

This game is built in [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php), a fantasy game console with a very restricted set of tools, and a focus on simplicity.

I've tried making games in the past, but have often felt my ideas getting too complex, or that I get bogged down by the learning curve of a whole game engine. PICO-8 forces developers to keep things simple by only providing an incredibly limited set of tools with which to author a game.

One of my favorite things about PICO-8 is that an entire game is just small enough that the entire mental model can fit in your head as you're developing it. I also find myself continually delighted while working on this game, because it's so easy to make things happen. PICO-8 includes:

* An [API](https://neko250.github.io/pico8-api/)
* A code editor (optional)
* A sprite editor
* A map editor
* A sound effect editor
* A music sequencer

...and that's it. The engine itself is left to you. PICO-8 gives you functions to `_update` and `_draw` your game at 30FPS (60 is optional), and leaves everything else to you.

Need a text engine? Write one. Need a sprite animation library? That's on you. Want to apply physics to your sprites? You need to sit under a tree and have an apple hit you on the head and then you go and write the code.

If you're looking for an introductory platform for game development, then PICO-8 is definitely worth a look. I will also attempt to add comments to this code in order to more effectively illustrate how it works. I'll also talk about some of the tools I created in this README, so that you might take them and reuse them in your own games.

At time of writing we're still working on this game, so I'm not quite ready to share its secrets, but I think the code is also fairly self-explanatory. I'll update this README when the game engine is a little more settled.

## Any questions?

I can't help you write your game, but I can help explain how this one works if you need. [Get in touch with me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Jonic) and I'll see what I can do.

## Contributions welcome!

If you think you can help improve this game or spot a bug, please let me know! I'd love this game to be a well commented source for beginners to get to grips with PICO-8 (despite being a beginner myself), so help with that is also welcome.
